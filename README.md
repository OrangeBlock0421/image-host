# **DISCLAIMER. 99% OF ALL CHARACTER IMAGES ARE *AI GENERATED.* I KNOW THE ETHICAL PROBLEMS WITH IT. I DO NOT ENJOY USING IT. I AM WORKING ON MY ART SKILL.**
Exceptions to this include but are not limited to: Profile pictures in the [Totally Not Intravenous][xeonnintra] section, the images for Pepper in the [Cosmonious High][xeoncosmo] section (Pepper_Pam is a crop of artwork drawn of my character that I had permission to use, the other's a recolor of promo art)

Last Five Changes (when applicable): 
- [Another new roleplay][mode] has started, some magical fantasy mess. This update begins the influx of characters from it.
- Reformatted the *[README.MD](https://github.com/OrangeBlock0421/image-host/blob/main/README.md)* with fancier markdown. More formatting changes, more formatting changes!
- [A new roleplay][xeonaug] has started, a rebel group in an alternate timeline to my base universe. This update includes their AI and a lot more of their members that weren't already present in this repository.

TL;DR: I put images and stuff here, broke it once, there's no code here, thanks for your interest anyway

Greetings, stranger! I see you've stumbled across my GitHub repository.  
This started out as a way to host images for the [Tupperbox][exttupper] Discord bot, because at the time, they still relied mostly on links if you wanted full quality. Now don't get me wrong, that's still mostly what it is, just for my characters specifically because my friend uses Tupperbox's own uploading system now. Over time, I started putting more on here, like wallpapers for Discord, icons for Discord, a couple Beat Saber maps, a sound file, and icons in general.  
This is actually a remake of this repository, as the previous one was broken by me trying and failing to use [GitLFS][extlfs] for what I think was a Minecraft save. It's been reorganized a few times, the images on the root are only there because my friend was being uncooperative and I physically could not move the pictures without breaking all his tuppers, which he didn't want to deal with. If you see files organized in a way that doesn't seem like it matches how a large portion of them are, that's why.  
I'm typing all this on a crappy laptop running Arch Linux and KDE Plasma. Why am I saying this? Because damn if I'm not bored right now.  
This repo has come a long way, and it only has further to grow.  
If you came here looking for code, then please refer to the image below.  
Thanks for your interest!
