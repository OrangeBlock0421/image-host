<b>DISCLAIMER. 99% OF ALL CHARACTER IMAGES ARE <i>AI GENERATED.</i> I KNOW THE ETHICAL PROBLEMS WITH IT. I DO NOT ENJOY USING IT. I AM WORKING ON OTHER METHODS.</b>
Exceptions to this include but are not limited to: Profile pictures in the "Totally Not Intravenous" section, the images for Pepper in the Cosmonious High section (Pepper_Pam is a crop of artwork drawn of my character that I had permission to use, the other's a recolor of promo art)

Greetings, stranger! I see you've stumbled across my GitHub repository. This started out as a way to host images for the Tupperbox Discord bot, because at the time, they still relied mostly on links if you wanted full quality. Now don't get me wrong, that's still mostly what it is, just for my characters specifically because my friend uses Tupperbox's own uploading system now. Over time, I started putting more on here, like wallpapers for Discord, icons for Discord, a couple Beat Saber maps, a sound file, and icons in general. This is actually a remake of this repository, as the previous one was broken by me trying and failing to use GitLFS for what I think was a Minecraft save. It's been reorganized a few times, the images on the root are only there because my friend was being uncooperative and I physically could not move the pictures without breaking all his tuppers, which he didn't want to deal with. If you see files organized in a way that doesn't seem like it matches how a large portion of them are, that's why.
I'm typing all this on a crappy laptop running Arch Linux and KDE Plasma. Why am I saying this? Because damn if I'm not bored right now.
This repo has come a long way, and it only has further to grow.
If you came here looking for code, then please refer to the image below.
Thanks for your interest!
