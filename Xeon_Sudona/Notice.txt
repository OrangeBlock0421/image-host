A portion of the characters in these folders will not be organized correctly.
This is due to me not writing things down properly, and not knowing when they were made.
Since I'm sure I've deleted the previous repository, I can't go check commits to find out.
Since the character info documents on my hard drive have all decided to change their "Date Created" to the day I reorganized my local folder, I can't check them either.
Bear with me, I'm trying.
Not like you can tell anyway...

I'm trying to organize them based on when they were made and where they first appeared. There might be some discrepancies as a result.
If it's a unique species, it'll be organized based on where they originated. Like the Zaiphein, Nevikem, Altogen, etc.
